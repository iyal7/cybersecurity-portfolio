# Network Security Basics

## Introduction
Networks allow computers and devices to communicate with each other. 
In cybersecurity, understanding how data moves across a network is 
essential for identifying and preventing attacks.

## Key Networking Concepts

### IP Address
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network. 
It allows devices to find and communicate with each other.

### DNS
Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable website names 
into IP addresses that computers can understand.

### Packets
Data sent over a network is broken into small units called packets. 
These packets travel across the network and are reassembled at the destination.

### HTTP vs HTTPS
- HTTP sends data in plain text
- HTTPS encrypts data to protect it from attackers

## Why This Matters for Security
- Attackers often target network traffic
- Unencrypted data can be intercepted
- Secure communication protects user data

## What I Learned
- Basic networking terminology
- How data travels across networks
- The importance of encrypted communication
