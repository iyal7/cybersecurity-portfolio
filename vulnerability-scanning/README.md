# Vulnerability Scanning 

## Introduction
Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying potential weaknesses 
in systems and networks. It is commonly used by security teams to find 
misconfigurations and exposed services before attackers do.

## What is Nmap?
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a tool used to discover hosts, open ports, 
and services running on a network.

## Common Scan Types (Learning Only)
- `nmap -sS` – TCP SYN scan
- `nmap -sV` – Service version detection
- `nmap -p` – Scan specific ports

## Interpreting Results
- Open ports indicate services running on a system
- Unnecessary open ports can increase security risk
- Scanning helps identify what needs to be secured

## Ethical Use
Nmap should only be used on systems you own or 
in authorized lab environments.

## What I Learned
- The purpose of vulnerability scanning
- Basic Nmap concepts
- The importance of ethical security testing
