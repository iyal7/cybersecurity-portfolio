# Linux Security Basics

## Introduction
Linux is widely used in cybersecurity because many servers, security tools, 
and cloud systems run on Linux. Understanding basic Linux commands and 
permissions is essential for protecting systems.

## Linux Commands Learned
- `pwd` – Shows the current directory
- `ls` – Lists files and directories
- `cd` – Changes directories
- `whoami` – Shows the current user

## File Permissions
Linux controls access to files using permissions:
- Read (r)
- Write (w)
- Execute (x)

Permissions help prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive files.

## Why This Matters for Security
- Limits who can access important files
- Prevents accidental or malicious changes
- Helps administrators control system access

## What I Learned
- How to navigate the Linux file system
- The importance of user permissions
- How Linux improves system security
